This is a web-app that aims to address all your module woes in one place! Using this, you can plan for your coming semesters, by choosing module combinations and checking if they are compatible to your current plan as per pre-requisities, preclusions, corequisities, etc. You can also use this to have an overview of your current progress in terms of the MCs you have cleared under different graduation requirements. Equipped with a chatroom and a CAP calculator (along with links to important module websites), ModPlaNUS is here to make your university journey easier!
